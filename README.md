## 📌 Problem Statement

We addressed the challenge: "Empowering Anonymous Civic Engagement through Decentralized Platforms"  
This challenge focuses on enabling citizens to report local issues anonymously, overcoming barriers like fear of retaliation or lack of access. It matters because it fosters transparency, accountability, and community participation in governance, especially in regions with limited digital literacy or infrastructure, by leveraging voice-based input and blockchain security.

## 💡 Our Solution

VoiceForAll is a decentralized complaint submission and voting system designed for citizens, particularly in underserved regions. It allows anonymous reporting of issues via text, photos, and voice (transcribed to English), with blockchain-secured voting and Twitter integration for public action. Impactful for enhancing civic engagement, it empowers users with secure, accessible tools to influence governance and hold authorities accountable.
